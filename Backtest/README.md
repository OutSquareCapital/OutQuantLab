# Backtest

**Backtest** is a Python package that facilitates the development and testing of trading strategies by providing tools for parameter generation and signal processing. It emphasizes flexibility, scalability, and the ability to handle large datasets effectively.

## Key Functionalities

### 1. Parameter Generation
- **Dynamic Range Creation**: Define parameter ranges with options for linear or logarithmic scaling. This allows fine-tuning of strategies by exploring different parameter configurations.
- **Combination Validation**: Ensure that generated parameter combinations meet predefined conditions, such as maintaining logical relationships between short-term and long-term metrics.
- **Class-Based Organization**: Group parameter options by their indicator classes, making it easier to handle a diverse set of strategies and configurations.

### 2. Signal Processing
- **Signal Initialization**: Generate and manage signals for multiple strategies across numerous assets, ensuring efficient handling of complex datasets.
- **Application on Returns**: Combine signals with volatility-adjusted returns to enhance the robustness of backtest results. The package supports long and short biases during signal application.
- **Output Data Structures**: Results are presented as cleanly formatted DataFrames, which can be seamlessly integrated into further analysis pipelines.

### Modules

1. **`ParametersGeneration`**:
   - Provides tools for creating parameter ranges, filtering valid parameter combinations, and organizing options by indicator class. This module ensures systematic parameter handling, reducing the risk of invalid configurations.

2. **`Returns_Calculations`**:
   - Contains methods for applying trading signals, computing strategy returns, and generating outputs in structured formats. The focus is on computational efficiency and compatibility with large-scale backtests.

### Initialization File

The `__init__.py` file simplifies access by exposing the primary functions of the package, including parameter generation and signal processing tools.

```python
from .ParametersGeneration import param_range_values, automatic_generation
from .Returns_Calculations import SignalsProcessing
```

This package is designed to serve as a foundational tool for systematic trading, ensuring flexibility and performance for large-scale backtesting tasks.
